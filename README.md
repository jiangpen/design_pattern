#it is the design pattern practice of JiangPeng.

In this practice, I use C++ to implement below pattern:

*singleton//only create a single instance
*abstractfactory//goal: to create different instance dynamically with different parameter
*builder//goal: to create instance with different attibutes by setting different parameter
*adapter //goal: to encapcuate the existing interfaces to new interface, these interace are not comppatible
*bridge //Goal:interface and implement can vary different.
*composite
*decorator
*facade
*proxy
*observer//goal: notify the 

*Chain of responsibility
*command
*Visitor
*Strategy
*Mediator
